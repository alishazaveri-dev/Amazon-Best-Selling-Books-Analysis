This project is a deep dive into the dynamics of Amazon's book market, using a Jupyter Notebook to track real-time bestsellers. It begins with careful web scraping to pull the latest data, then shifts into a PySpark environment for robust data engineering and cleaning, transforming raw book metrics into an insightful 'Popularity Score' (Rating $\times$ Reviews). The final output involves compelling data visualization to reveal market trends, top authors, and the most engaging titles. This work clearly showcases proficiency in Python, Big Data processing (PySpark), web scraping/data collection, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), making it a great example of a complete, end-to-end data pipeline.
